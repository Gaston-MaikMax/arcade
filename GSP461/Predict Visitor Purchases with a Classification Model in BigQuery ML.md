### Task 2.**``**

```lookml

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
  `bracketology.ncaa_model_updated`
OPTIONS
  ( model_type='logistic_reg') AS

SELECT

  pace_rating,

  # opponent pace
  opp_poss_40min,

FROM `bracketology.training_new_features`

# here we'll train on 2014 - 2017 and predict on 2018
WHERE season BETWEEN 2014 AND 2017 # between in SQL is inclusive of end points
