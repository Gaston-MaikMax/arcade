### Step 1 **`Update order_items`**

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
  query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [depart_week, distance_tiered]
      measures: [count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2003"]
    }
  }
```

### Step 2 **`Title the Look`**

```

Flight Count by Departure Week and Distance Tier

```

### Step 3 **`Reorder columns and remove fields`**

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
  query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [aircraft_origin.state]
      measures: [percent_cancelled]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2000"]
    }
  }

```

### Step 4 **`Title the Look`**

```

Percent of Flights Cancelled by State in 2000

```

### Step 5 **`Use table calculations to calculate simple percentages`**

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [aircraft_origin.state]
      measures: [cancelled_count, count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "2004"]
    }
}

```

```

${flights.cancelled_count}/${flights.count}

```

```

Percent of Flights Cancelled by Aircraft Origin 2004

```

### Step 6 **`Use table calculations to calculate percentages of a total`**

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query: start_from_here{
      dimensions: [carriers.name]
      measures: [total_distance]
    }
}

```

```

${flights.total_distance}/${flights.total_distance:total}

```

```

Percent of Total Distance Flown by Carrier

```

### Step 7 **`Use functions in table calculations`**

```lookml
# Place in `faa` model
explore: +flights {
    query:start_from_here {
      dimensions: [depart_year, distance_tiered]
      measures: [count]
      filters: [flights.depart_date: "after 2000/01/01"]
    }
}

```

```

(${flights.count}-pivot_offset(${flights.count}, -1))/pivot_offset(${flights.count}, -1)

```

```

YoY Percent Change in Flights flown by Distance, 2000-Present

```
